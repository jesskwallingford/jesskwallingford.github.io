    "text": "I am a PhD candidate at the Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy at Tufts University where I work with Dr. William Masters on the Food Prices for Nutrition project. My dissertation research focuses on the links between diet quality, time use, and food group prices.\nPrior to Tufts, I worked as a consultant for the Trade and Agriculture Directorate of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) (Paris, France), where I developed a case study of the processed food sector, with a focus on the trade-offs and synergies across environmental, livelihood, and health objectives. During my time at the OECD, I also monitored food and agricultural policies induced by the COVID-19 pandemic, with particular attention to trade restrictions.  \nI hold a Master of Science in agriculture, food, and the environment from the Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy (Boston, MA, USA), a Master of Science in neuroscience from McMaster University (Hamilton, ON, Canada), and a Bachelor of Science in neuroscience, biochemistry and molecular biology from Dalhousie University (Halifax, NS, Canada). During my Bachelor’s degree and first Master’s degree, I acquired foundational knowledge of the molecular, cellular, and physiological processes underpinning human health and the interactions between nutrition and health. I am especially interested in leveraging my interdisciplinary training to communicate across scientific disciplines, bridge the academic-policy divide, and improve access to healthy and sustainable diets globally.\nI also became a parent in 2021 and currently live in Montréal with my family.\n\nEducation\nPhD, Agriculture, Food and Environment (expected 2025) | Tufts University\nDissertation committee: William A.
